Project Policies
=======================

The aim of this policy revision is to improve transparency and facilitate broader
community participation in Libc++ decision-making processes.


The following document presents clear processes and expectations for documenting, discussing, and
modifying the policies of libc++. The emphasis is on documenting rational to encourage broader participation 
and Fluid modifications.

Consensus Building First...
---------------------------
.. note::

    A policy represents or builds consensus and should not be a "one-time" decision but an ongoing process.
    All policy discussions should strive towards consensus building rather than rule setting.


What is a "Policy"?
===================

A "Policy" in libc++ is any decision applying project-wide and becomes crucial for new contributors.

Policies aim improve the quality of the project, relationships between contributors, and the community.
They do so by clearly communicating expectations and processes in a manner available to all developers.

Policies factors include:

*  Technical decisions
*  Community decisions
*  Governance decisions
*  Any other project-wide applications.

Policies are not "rules" but rather a consensus of the community. They should be followed, but they can be modified.

Policies come with their own costs and as such must  "pull their own weight".

What should a policy do?
-------------------------



These improvements
should be measurable and observable. Policies should be "lightweight" and not impose unnecessary restrictions on the community.

Policies must "carry their own weight". Every policy


Purpose of Policy Documentation
---------------------------------

Policy Documentation aims to:

-  Offer a clear understanding of the decision-making process to other users
-  Allow proposing modifications to the policy with complete comprehension of the current policy and the reason behind it.
-  Establish policies in any forum, provided it then gets documented with the rationale.

Requirements for Policy Documentation
======================================

The policy documentation must:

-  Provide a clear description of the policy.
-  Include a clear description of the rationale behind the policy, bringing forward the pros and cons, and providing practical examples, if possible.
-  If possible, state examples of what new information could cause the policy to be modified.

Process for Adding or Modifying Policies
========================================

Process for policy modifications includes:

-  Discussing policy changes on PR's modifying the policy document.
-  The process should focus on consensus building.
-  Any user can suggest policy modifications at any time, supporting a more "fluid" consensus as the process is ongoing.
