Error: Invalid use of postcondition specifier with auto return type

In the declaration:
    auto f() post(r : r);

A postcondition specifier with a result-name-introducer cannot be used on a function declaration with a placeholder return type (auto). Such postconditions are only allowed on function definitions.

To fix this, either:
1. Provide a concrete return type instead of 'auto', or
2. Make this a function definition by adding a function body, or
3. Remove the result-name-introducer from the postcondition
