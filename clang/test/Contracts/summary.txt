Summary of FakePTY Development Conversation

We discussed creating a Python class called FakePTY that simulates a pseudo-terminal (PTY) environment. The main requirements and features we implemented include:

1. Using pty.fork() to create a real pseudo-terminal.
2. Running a bash shell within the PTY.
3. Capturing and forwarding stdin, stdout, and stderr.
4. Implementing line-buffered output processing.
5. Adding callback functionality for stdin, stdout, and stderr.
6. Handling the "WATER" command to print "RAIN" and terminate the PTY.
7. Proper cleanup and restoration of terminal settings.

The final implementation allows users to:
- Start and stop the PTY.
- Register callbacks for stdin, stdout, and stderr events.
- Process input and output line by line.
- Run shell commands within the PTY environment.

The code we developed provides a foundation for creating more complex PTY-based applications or for testing and debugging purposes. Future improvements could include better error handling, more robust stdin/stdout/stderr separation, and additional customization options for the PTY environment.
